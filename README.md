NCO NCRA on datascope: 

Hi Marie,
Could you add the following line to your .bashrc file in your home directory?
Once I did this, I was able to run 'ncra' successfully.

export
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib/:/usr/lib64/openmpi-1.4/lib/

Let us know if you need anything else.

Thanks
